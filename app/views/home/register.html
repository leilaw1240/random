                                    <li>Our software package contains certain features designed to detect use of automated programs
                                        that enable artificial (non-human) intelligence to play on our site. Use of such
                                        'bot' software programs violates Our Terms and Conditions of Use, where we deem it
                                        detrimental to other players. By installing our software and using the Services,
                                        You consent to our software performing the functions described in this section. Our
                                        software may perform any or all of the following functions in order to detect the
                                        use of illicit automated programs and ensure that we maintain a 'cheat free' environment

                                    <li>Scan your list of active software applications while you are using the services. Scan
                                        your list of active processes while you are using the services; and Scan the files
                                        in your services and site-related program folders to ensure that only 'non-hacked'
                                        versions of our software are being used. If any of the foregoing processes reveals

                                    <li>Our software may scan the files associated with the suspect application or process and
                                        compile a composite mesh (i.e. a profile that characterizes the files associated
                                        with the application or process) to be matched against profiles for known illicit
                                        automated programs. Our software will not perform any random search of large portions
                                        of your hard drive, equipment or files, and it will not transmit any information
